This was officially the first project I worked on.

Home Run Team is a construction company located in Jacksonville FL. Initially, they didn't have a website, once I realized that, I thought it would be interesting to offer myself to make them one.

The website is very "basic" and straight forward and it contains mainly HTML and CSS. It is live at https://teamhomerun.com
 
The design was also made by me from scratch. It has a responsive design and it is adapted to multiple screen sizes.
